Random Data: This simulates an average case scenario.

Sorted Data: Best case for some algorithms, worst case for others.

Reverse Sorted Data: Often the worst case for many algorithms.

Nearly Sorted Data: This can be used to test how well the algorithm handles almost
sorted data.

Few Unique Data: Data with many duplicate values to test how the algorithm handles repetition.


Iterations:

Insight into Complexity: Counting iterations helps understand the number of times the algorithm's core loop is executed. This can give insights into the algorithm's time complexity.
Performance Analysis: Comparing the number of iterations for different algorithms on the same dataset can help determine which algorithm performs fewer operations, thereby indicating potential efficiency.
Swaps:

Operation Cost: Swaps are often more costly operations because they involve multiple assignments. Tracking swaps helps evaluate the cost of the sorting algorithm in terms of data movement.
Algorithm Efficiency: Some algorithms, like selection sort, tend to have fewer swaps compared to others. Knowing the number of swaps can highlight such differences and help choose the right algorithm for specific scenarios.
Array Accesses:

Memory Efficiency: Array accesses indicate how many times elements in the array are read or written. This can be crucial for understanding the memory efficiency of an algorithm.
Cache Performance: Algorithms with fewer array accesses may perform better in terms of cache usage, leading to better overall performance on modern hardware.
