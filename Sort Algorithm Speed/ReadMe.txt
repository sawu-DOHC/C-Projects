Random Data: This simulates an average case scenario.

Sorted Data: Best case for some algorithms, worst case for others.

Reverse Sorted Data: Often the worst case for many algorithms.

Nearly Sorted Data: This can be used to test how well the algorithm handles almost
sorted data.

Few Unique Data: Data with many duplicate values to test how the algorithm handles repetition.
